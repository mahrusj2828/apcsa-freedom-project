# APCSA Freedom Project
by Mahrus Jahan

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study Godot in order to help me make a 2D RPG Game.

## Implications
##### PROS
#### Global
* ##### Big Systems: Godot can be used to develop games and interactive media that integrate with global platforms like Steam, itch.io, mobile app stores, and even web-based games
#### Social
* #### Individual: Indie Developers and hobbyists can create games without expensive licensing fees, and artists and designers can experiment with 2D/3D game creation without needing deep programming knowledge
* #### Relationships: Godot’s active community helps developers connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. In addition, multiplayer game development can foster online social interactions among players.
* #### Culture: Developers can create games that reflect cultural stories, art styles, and traditions, helping preserve and share them globally.
#### Economic
* #### Jobs: Indie Game Developers can monetize their Godot-made games on platforms like Steam, Google Play, or the App Store, and freelancers & studios can use Godot for contract work (game development, simulations, interactive apps) without worrying about engine licensing costs.


##### CONS
#### Global
* ##### Big Systems: Godot is not as widely used in AAA studios compared to Unity or Unreal Engine, meaning fewer high-profile examples and less mainstream recognition.
#### Social
* #### Individual: While Godot is great for 2D, its 3D capabilities (though improving) are not as polished as Unreal Engine’s or other AAA studios and, compared to Unity/Unreal, there are fewer in-depth guides for high-end graphics, VR, or multiplayer networking.
* #### Relationships: Godot has a smaller community than other studios, meaning fewer networking opportunities with top-tier developers. There is also less industry recognition, which might matter for job-seeking developers.
* #### Culture: There is less mainstream cultural impact, making it harder to attract big investors or publishers.
#### Economic
* #### Jobs: Most studios still prefer Unity/Unreal experience, with clients requesting to work more with Unity/Unreal than Godot, limiting career opportunities for Godot specialists.
