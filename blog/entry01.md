* This year for my Freedom Project, I have been tinkering with [Godot](https://godotengine.org), which is a cross-platform and open-source game engine that can be used to make 2D or 3D games or applications. It can be used with many coding languages including C++, C# and GDScript. With Godot, I want to try to make a 2D RPG game. I looked at some examples of past creations so that I could get an idead of what specifically I would make my game about. I also looked at different [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s) on Youtube to show me the basics of Godot. What I had learned so far felt similar to what I had already learned so far in Java. To create a game, I am presented with a scene where I am able to use nodes with scripts that are attached to each node and update the objects. I started experimenting how to make shapes. To create a background, I had to create the root of the scene using `Node2D` that I renamed to `Background`. I then added a `Sprite` node underneath it to try to display a 2D image. It looks like following:

```gdscript
    Node2D
      Background
         Sprite2D
```

* I will continue to experiment to see how I can add more to the background and how I could design the area where the main character would start in.

* For this blog, I am currently between the Research and Brainstorming part of the Engineering Design Process (EDP) where I am researching how Godot works and am brainstorming how to use GdScript to create different elements of the game I want make. I hope to be on the Planning part of the EDP where I figure what things I will do first to ensure that my game is detailed. While working on this blog, I have been working on the skill of "How to Learn". This is an important skill for me to learn because there is wide range of elements my tool has to offer that I can learn and then use to make a detailed game. Another skill that is important for me to learn is "How to Google" because learning a new coding language isn't easy and using online sources helps me to better understand the concept through instructions and examples of how the language is being used.
